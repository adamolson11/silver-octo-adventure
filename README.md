This is a JavaScript password generator that takes in prompts from the user and assigns a random password with it.

I took the original source code of the project and then added to it so that the page would randomize a password given a few inputs. You need the length of the password and then
what type of characters are going to be used in the password. you then create from those given inputs and use a for loop to iterate over the resource. This throughput creates the randomized password. 
Lastly, I took the newly generated password and wrote it into the text field using the ID tag #password from the html Document. the click password creates an event so that the code is not executed until the button is clicked.
